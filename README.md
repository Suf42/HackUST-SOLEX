This is a simple C++ application which is supposed to mimic a decentralised desktop/mobile app interface where users of SOLEX can buy and sell domestic and commercial shares of renwable energy generated on an offshore solar energy farm using blockchain technology. The purpose of this app is to promote commercial trade of renwable energy and increase the share of renewable energy in our fuel mix and supply renewable energy to developing countries.

Our application is capable of performing simple user login process, checking your account balance and creating simple buy/sell transactions for energy tokens.
